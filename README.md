# StockClustering
A research project that investigates applications of hierarchical clustering in complex Stock network.  
* We performed various Linkage Algorithms on SP500 and benchmark them against GICS.
* We compared Ward Linkage vs Directed Hierarchical Bubble Tree (DBHT).
* We tailored a version of DBHT with Ward Linkage that improves its ARI by 20%.
* We constructed a portfolio using the hierarchy produced above and the famous **Hierarchical Risk Parity** algorithm.
